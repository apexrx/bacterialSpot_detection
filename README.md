# Bell Pepper Bacterial Spot Classification

Bacterial spot, caused by Xanthomonas bacteria, is a significant disease affecting bell peppers, leading to dark, water-soaked lesions on leaves and fruits, which reduces yield and marketability. Early detection and classification of infected plants are crucial for effective disease management. This project presents a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model developed to classify bacterial spot disease in bell peppers using images from the PlantVillage dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset utilized is the **PlantVillage Bell Pepper Dataset**, comprising **2,475 labeled images** of bell pepper leaves categorized as either:
- **Healthy** (1,478 images)
- **Infected with bacterial spot disease** (997 images)

These images are standardized to **256x256 pixels**.
For more details, refer to the [PlantVillage Dataset on Mendeley](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/tywbtsjrjv/1).

## Data Splitting
The dataset is split into:
- **80% Training**
- **10% Validation**
- **10% Testing**

### Caching, Shuffling, and Prefetching
To optimize data loading, the dataset is cached, shuffled, and prefetched using TensorFlowâ€™s `AUTOTUNE` feature.

```python
train_ds = train_ds.cache().shuffle(1000).prefetch(buffer_size=tf.data.AUTOTUNE)
val_ds = val_ds.cache().shuffle(1000).prefetch(buffer_size=tf.data.AUTOTUNE)
test_ds = test_ds.cache().shuffle(1000).prefetch(buffer_size=tf.data.AUTOTUNE)
```

### Image Resizing and Normalization
Images are resized and rescaled to normalize pixel values.

```python
resize_rescale = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Resizing(IMAGE_SIZE, IMAGE_SIZE),
    tf.keras.layers.Rescaling(1./255)
])
```

### Data Augmentation
To improve generalization, random flipping and rotation are applied.

```python
data_aug = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.RandomFlip("horizontal_and_vertical"),
    tf.keras.layers.RandomRotation(0.2)
])
```

## Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model
A CNN architecture is implemented using TensorFlow/Keras with the following characteristics:
- **Input Shape:** `(BATCH_SIZE, IMAGE_SIZE, IMAGE_SIZE, CHANNELS)`
- **Three Convolutional Layers:**
  - Conv2D (32 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation) + MaxPooling2D
  - Conv2D (64 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation) + MaxPooling2D
  - Conv2D (128 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation) + MaxPooling2D
- **Flatten Layer:** Converts the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector.
- **Fully Connected Layers:**
  - Dense (512 neurons, ReLU activation)
  - Dense (2 neurons, softmax activation for classification)
- **Loss Function:** Sparse categorical cross-entropy
- **Optimizer:** Adam

```python
model = models.Sequential([
    resize_rescale,
    data_aug,
    layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(512, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(n_classes, activation='softmax')
])
```

## Performance
The model achieved **100% accuracy** on the test dataset.

## Future Improvements
- Evaluate performance on a larger and more diverse dataset.
- Implement transfer learning using pretrained models like VGG19 or ResNet.
- Fine-tune hyperparameters to improve generalization.
